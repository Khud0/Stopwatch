# Stopwatch
A Stopwatch for achieving goals. Turn it on when you start doing something and pause when you take a break. This Stopwatch will count how much time you spend doing something and how long are your breaks.

It is a lightweight, simplistic and functional Stopwatch.

It can be used as a normal Stopwatch or, for example, as a "Pomodorro" timer. When you Pause the Stopwatch, it starts to count your "downtime", showing you how much time is wasted (or used thoughtfully to relax).
